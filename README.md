**control automatic of an air conditioner and a fan using LabVIEW** 
This mini-project aims to control a fan and an air conditioner in an advanced and smart way using LabVIEW, Arduino, and temperature sensors. We implemented automated control techniques, such as automatic recording of temperature and humidity data to the cloud, real-time visualization through graphs, and automatic email notifications to provide updates on temperature and humidity conditions.
